# The Assignment: Employee Directory

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.

  This Assignment was a great introduction to React and all its capabilities when using the components to setup the web page the developer has so much freedom to manipulate every piece of the page with ease. Experience with React has been the one part of this class I was very worried about but I am so glad for because it is the best tool to have in your arsenal. This assignment was to create an react based employee directory that can be manipulated by the standards above. Sorted by one category and also filtered by one property this was accomplished by setting up each component independently and using JS to execute the parameters listed above. 

  # Lessons:

  This assignment showed me the basics and some of the more in depth React. I was able to gain experience, develop, and fix errors with react which I found very challenging but also very fun. While setting up the components in react the page will not load at all so checking to make sure your work is correct is left to debugging after the framework is all constructed correctly. In this class we have learned so much about the full stack web development and having react experience is by far the most important behind javascript and since react is written in javascript they go hand in hand. 

  # Takeaways:

  I have taken a lot from this class as a whole and I am eager to learn much more we are nearing the end of the class and with each assignment I know I have been able to utilize my new abilities and showcase them in each assignment. I take with me a great appreciation of the curriculum and though it was painstaking and stressful I am happy with the amount of information covered in the class. I have looked ahead and see an assignment of updating my portfolio using react I don't have the details but making my portfolio more interactive and much more scalable to add to will be exciting and a great help to my career as a web developer.
