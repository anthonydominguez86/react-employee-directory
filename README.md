  This Assignment was a great introduction to React and all its capabilities when using the components to setup the web page the developer has so much freedom to manipulate every piece of the page with ease. Experience with React has been the one part of this class I was very worried about but I am so glad for because it is the best tool to have in your arsenal. This assignment was to create an react based employee directory that can be manipulated by the standards above. Sorted by one category and also filtered by one property this was accomplished by setting up each component independently and using JS to execute the parameters listed above.
